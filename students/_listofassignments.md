# List of Student Assignments

This is a list for us to work from. It won't be included in the final website repo that we create. (I'm proposing that files that are just for us get named with an underscore at the start.)

## Before the Actual Creative Coding GHC Assignments

* Overview of Twine/Twee (why we're using this as a way to learn creative coding; what's the difference between Twee/Twine; show examples of Twee/Twine games)
* Getting Started (what is git/github/ghc, signing up for github)
  * Installing Git (windows and mac instructions based on video)
  * Installing Tweego and Sugarcube (windows and mac instructions based on video)
  * Installing VS Code (windows and mac instructions based on video)

*From this point on, windows/mac distinction does not matter...*

* GitHub Classroom (how to accept an assignment)
  * Accept first assignment (by accepting assignment, cloning repo in vsc, writing some markdown, committing and pushing to github)

## Creative Coding Technical Assignments

These are GitHub Classroom assignments created by the instructor (probably using a template we've provided) that will have students learning the technical aspects of creating stories - before starting the writing/creative assignments. 

***At the same time, stress that everything should be considered a creative opportunity and that each prompt to create a tiny tech demo should also involve a creative writing aspect***

* First Twee repo (introducing them to how to set up a twee repo, how to write and compile a story, and how to submit a twee GHC assignment)
* Creating passage links and basic Sugarcube formatting (submit a three passage story - with links - that includes formatting features that have been introduced)
* How to publish a story using GitHub Pages, so anyone on the Internet can read the story (supply them with the story - this is a mini assignment that has more to do with GitHub than anything) *Remember that students must have admin rights on their repo for this to work - and that it must be a public repo*
* Advanced Sugarcube formatting, and HTML/CSS formatting. An assignment that requires students to create a new three passage story that includes the new techniques shown in the assignment)
* Interaction in Sugarcube, using variables, control structures, macros, and Javascript (this could be worth breaking into two assignments, since it's the meat of the "coding" aspect of the OER). Ask students to create a new minimal story that uses several forms of advanced interaction (maybe give suggestions or a list from which they can choose a specific quantity to use/demonstrate)
* Using Chapel custom Sugarcube macros. Ask students to create a new minimal story that uses one of the macros. (probably suggest a handful of them that are relatively simple and useful)

## Story Creation Assignments

A sequence of assignments that might happen more than once, depending on how many story creation assignments the instructor wants to do in the span of the semester/year/workshop/etc.

* An assignment that discusses aspects of creative writing, and unique considerations for *interactive* narratives. Students are asked to come up with three narrative ideas and submit them to the assignment repo (maybe as three markdown files). *Instructor documentation may need to include instructions for using PRs for feedback?*
* More considerations for interactive narratives, maybe. And an assignment that requires students to create and submit a map of their proposed narrative's passages.
* The actual story assignment and repo (note the Public/Admin note above re:GitHub Pages). This will need to require regular - scheduled by the instructor - commits of drafts. This could go on for weeks, using this same repo.
