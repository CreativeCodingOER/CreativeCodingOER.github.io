# Links to Reference in the Assignments

These are links that we might point students to in the content, rather than trying to replicate it ourselves.

## VS Code

* The Welcome page in VS Code has "Quick Setup" and "Learn the Fundamentals" checklists for beginners
* 5 minute video tutorial: [Getting started with Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/introvideos/basics)
* Additional things that are confusing for beginners that we will need to explain:
  * The difference between opening a folder and opening a file
  * Opening the terminal pane vs starting a new terminal

## Markdown

* A very complete Markdown guide: https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/
* The GitHub Markdown guide (which is much shorter and has very minor differences to make Markdown simpler): https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/
* Markdown cheat sheet, with a second page about GitHub Markdown: https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf

## GitHub

* The github-starter-course repo, which we'd probably tell instructors to create as an assignment, using that template repo - just like we'd have them do with our own assignment templates
