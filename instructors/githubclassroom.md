How to Use GitHub Classroom, Git, and Classroom Assistant

* What are they, what's the relationship between them. Include a diagram?
* How to create an assignment
* How to download all student repos with CA and view them in VSC

## Notes

* Wondering if some simple explanations would be best described in TINY screen capture videos instead of text?
* Be sure to mention how students can't use GitHub Pages unless they have admin access to their assignment repo
* Also, assignments should be created as Public for the same reason (Github Pages)
