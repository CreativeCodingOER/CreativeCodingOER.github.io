Summary of how to use the materials, including how to distribute them (maybe info about how to organize them in their LMS?)

Should we include pictures and screen caps, like a 'how-to', for the installation of VSC and GitHub?

## List of technical instructional materials for students

* Intro to GitHub
  * Create a GitHub account
  * How to accept the invitation to join an organization and accept the first repo
  * What is cloning a repo, and why is it needed when we want to work on our computers in VSC.
* how to install software...
  * Maybe include screencaps from both Macand Window browsers about how to install VSC and Git on your computer
  * Provide a list of what extensions to add.
* One thing that wasn't included in my class but I would want to place here is how to configure GitHub Pages so their narrative repos are served directly from their repo)

## List of assignments

Not just a list of template repos, like we originally thought. It seems like maybe each of these assignments is a prompt/intro/context/references and that the template repo is mentioned as something that the instructor will need to use when creating the GHC assignment. We originally thought the template would contain all that semantic stuff but it really should just be starter code and/or a directory structure - so it only makes up a minor part of an "assignment."

* Assignment one
* Assignment two

(list materials by categories? in recommended sequences/collections? maybe not the technical list, since those require a certain order and aren't really optional - they're the minimum requirements)

## How to install VSC and Attatch GitHub

     Why do we want to edit files in VSC instead of in a GitHub web brower? 

Visual Studio Code (VSC) is a proper code editor that supplies color, highlighted syntax editing, and the ability to find errors in your code before you even run it.

We really only use the web browser to clone and download the repo, and then we can sync GitHub to VSC so that you don't have to constantly puch and pull from the original repo when you add new content.

* can we ask them to sync thier VSC to the GitHub, I remember talking about this once?

Another reason we use GitHub and VSC is beacause all the work you've done on a project is not dependent upon your harddrive. When you push to GitHub it saves all your work and changes, like a cloud, so your work is always being saved. It's like a back-up.

* You will never those it all! You will always be able to reclone your repo from your GitHub account.
