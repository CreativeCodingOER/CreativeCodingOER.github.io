Summary of how to use the materials, including how to distribute them (maybe info about how to organize them in their LMS?)

## List of technical instructional materials for students

* Intro to GitHub
* how to install software...
* One thing that wasn't included in my class but I would want to place here is how to configure GitHub Pages so their narrative repos are served directly from their repo)

## List of assignments

Not just a list of template repos, like we originally thought. It seems like maybe each of these assignments is a prompt/intro/context/references and that the template repo is mentioned as something that the instructor will need to use when creating the GHC assignment. We originally thought the template would contain all that semantic stuff but it really should just be starter code and/or a directory structure - so it only makes up a minor part of an "assignment."

* Assignment one
* Assignment two

(list materials by categories? in recommended sequences/collections? maybe not the technical list, since those require a certain order and aren't really optional - they're the minimum requirements)
